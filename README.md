## PyBank and PyPoll

In this work, I first created a python script, which analyses the financial records of PyBanks, after reading a set of finacial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). This dataset is composed of two columns: 
- > Date

- > Profit/Losses 

This python script would calculate the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


[Election Results](https://github.com/HJandu/Python_challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/Output/election_data.txt)







The second python script was created to analyse the election result of PyPoll.
